Here I bring you a method to listen spotify without ads using a free account in your Web Browser Player.

First, Install [uBlock](https://www.ublock.org/) then go to the Icon in the browser, then "Open the dashboard" and go to My filters snap.

There you can paste this spotify's media filters to not listen anymore to the anoyning Ads.

<code>
/mp3-ad/*$domain=open.spotify.com|play.spotify.com
||audio-fa.scdn.co/audio/$media,domain=open.spotify.com|play.spotify.com


See ya the next time.
