Here I bring you a method to listen spotify without ads using a free account in your Web Browser Player.

First, Install [uBlock](https://www.ublock.org/) then open the Icon, then "Open the dashboard" and go to My filters.

There you can paste this spotifys media filters to not listen anymore the anoyning Ads.

<code>
/mp3-ad/*$domain=open.spotify.com|play.spotify.com

||audio-fa.scdn.co/audio/$media,domain=open.spotify.com|play.spotify.com</code>

See ya the next time.
