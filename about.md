### More Information

This blog is called MicroSwitch because I started to ReverseEngenering my mouse to fix the MicroSwitch,
this is one of my first proyects to fix a hardware stuff brand to new using another mouse parts to fix
the actual Mouse. The problem was the clicking part, of the right button I tried to click and select but 
it couldnt do anything concrete. Thats when I disasemble the mouse and saw that the microswitch was broken,
and had to be replaced.
